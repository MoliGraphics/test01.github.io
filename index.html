        	<p> <strong>Audio adversarial examples.</strong> Driven by deep neural networks (DNN), speech recognition (SR) techniques are advancing rapidly and are widely used in practice. However, recent studies have investigated a crucial problem --- Given any audio clip <i>I</i> with transcript <i>T</i> (e.g., <i>“this is for you”</i> as shown in the figure below), by adding a carefully chosen small perturbation sound &delta; (imperceptible to people), the resulting audio <i>I</i>+&delta; can be recognized as some other targeted transcript <i>T'</i> (≠<i>T</i>, e.g., <i>“power off”</i>) by a speech recognition system. This composed audio <i>I</i>+&delta; is known as an audio adversarial example.</p>

        	<p> <strong>Over-the-air attacks.</strong> However, it is non-trivial to launch this attack to fool the neural network of a speech recognition (SR) system at the receiver side after the over-the-air transmission, because the effective audio signal received by SR after the transmission is <i>H</i>(<i>I</i>+&delta;), instead of <i>I</i>+&delta;, where <i>H</i>(&#8901) represents the signal distortion from the acoustic channel and also the distortion from the device hardware (speaker and microphone). Due to <i>H</i>(&#8901), the effective adversarial example may not lead to <i>T'</i> any more. Therefore, one open question is whether we can find a generic and robust &delta; that survives at any location in space, even when the attacker may not have a chance to measure <i>H</i>(&#8901) in advance.
