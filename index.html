	<body>I am a blablabla, and this is a short intro. Just a place holder here. Green infrastructure can be a centerpiece of smart regional and metropolitan planning, ensuring communities have a livable environment, with clean air and water, for generations to come. Green infrastructure can be designed to address the needs of wildlife, which are increasingly threatened by climate change, providing systems of corridors or greenways to enable movement through human settlements. Those corridors are often beautiful places that people want to live near, too.</body>
